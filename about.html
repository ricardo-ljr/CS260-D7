      This is my family, we're a family of three. <br />I'm so grateful for our
      little one and for the blessing she is to our lives
    </h2>
    <p>
      I look forward to seeing what the future holds for me and I'm excited to
      become even more passionate about programming as I sharpen my skills and
      further my career in software development. I'm well-prepared to
      transition-related education and hands-on projects to excel in an
      entry-level software engineer role.
